# Probabilities for FFG/Edge _Legends of the Five Rings_ dice system

You likely just want to reach for the `probabilities.csv` file, which contains most common results already compiled.

See the `maths.js` file if you're interested in the algorithm which was used to determine them.

Everything else is "code to make code" and of little relevance on its own.

Project inspired by and checked against the results of https://l5r-dice-sim.vercel.app/
